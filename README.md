#Rejected Talks

Ever had a talk you wrote and were ready to present somewhere only to have it rejected?  Well, we have too! Check them [out](http://rejectedtalks.github.io)!  Had an idea but it was rejected before you ever started work? Check them [out](http://rejectedtalks.github.io/ideas/) too!

##Add your own talk idea
To add your own talk idea to the list, just send us a pull request with the updated [ideas.json](https://github.com/rejectedtalks/ieas/blob/master/data/ideas.json) with your information and we'll merge it in!

###Requirements
* Talk should be ideas that you submitted. _If you have already written the slide deck or materials for the talk, please submit them to the regular [rejected talks](http://rejectedtalks.github.io)
* Idea should have been rejected. _Kinda a "no crap" requirement, but be honest.  If you didn't submit it somewhere, please don't add it here_

###Notes
* Talks can be on any subject
* Please tag your talks with a handful of relevant tags to make them easier to find

##History
This site came around when talking to @fourq at the 2014 Dreamforce about talks that people had done all the work to present only to have them rejected.  Out of this conversation came the idea to come up with a way for people to spread their talks to the world.
